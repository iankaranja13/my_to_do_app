## üìÑ File Descriptions

### `app.py`
- The **main script** users run to interact with the CLI app.
- Handles menu navigation, user input, and calls functions from `task.py` and `utils.py`.

### `task.py`
- Defines the `Task` class with properties like `id`, `title`, `description`, `due_date`, and `status`.
- May include task-related operations (e.g., load/save).

### `utils.py`
- Provides **helper functions** for input validation, formatting dates, generating unique task IDs, etc.

### `test_utils.py`
- Contains **unit tests** for verifying the correctness of utility functions.

### `tasks.json`
- Stores all tasks in **JSON format**.
- Acts as the app's local database.

### `.gitignore`
- Ensures files like `__pycache__/`, `venv/`, and logs aren't committed to Git.

### `app.log`
- Captures runtime logs, helpful for debugging or tracking issues.
